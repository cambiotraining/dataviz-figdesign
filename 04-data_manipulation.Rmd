# Transforming data - dplyr

In most of the cases you will need to change the format of your dataset because it will not be in the right format that you will need to plot or analyse the data.  `tidyverse` has a package called `dplyr` which contains functions that help you to select columns/rows, sort, combine and perform other data types of data transformations. In the next sections we will look at different ways to transform our dataset.  Now that we already know the basics of visualising data with `ggplot` we will also learn how to visualise other plots with the transformed dataset as we go along.  

:::note
To learn more about `dplyr` please look at the following resources:

## Pipes
Before we move onto the different ways that we can transform our data, we'll discuss one of the most powerful additions to R, **pipes**.

Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  Pipes in R look like
`%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically
with `dplyr`. 

Let's say we are interested only in the data that do not contain any missing values. Using pipes, we do the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
surveys %>%
  drop_na()
```

This takes the argument on the left (`surveys`) and passes it on to the function after it (`drop_na`, which removes all rows with missing values).

If we want to create a new object with the transformed data we can assign it a new name as below:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
                  drop_na()

surveys_complete
```

Although at this point pipes might not seem like a revolutionary invention, they become more powerful when combining multiple operations. This we'll see next.

## Selecting columns

To select columns of a data frame or tibble, use the`select` function. The first argument
is the data frame or tibble you are working on (in our example it is `surveys`, which we pipe through), and the subsequent arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Extract species_id, weight, hindfoot_lenth, year and sex columns from surveys dataset.
surveys %>% 
  select(species_id, weight, hindfoot_length, year, sex)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a `-` in front of the column to exclude it.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Select all columns of the surveys dataset apart from record_id and species_id columns.
surveys %>%
  select(-record_id, -species_id)
```

<br/>

## Filtering rows

To remove rows from a data frame or tibble use the `filter` function from the `dplyr` package.  The first argument is the data frame or tibble to perform the filtering on (in this case we pipe the data through) and the next arguments are the conditions on which to keep the rows. 

### Filtering rows by values

To choose rows based on a specific condition, use the `filter` function as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Keep only the observations of animals collected from 1995 onwards from the surveys dataset.
surveys %>% 
  filter(year >= 1995)
```

You can filter on multiple conditions:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Keep only the observations of animals collected from 1995 onwards
# that are female from the surveys dataset.
surveys %>% 
  filter(year >=1995,
         sex == "F")
```

:::note
**To quote or not to quote?**

The `sex` column is a character and thus needs to be quoted, whereas the `year` column is numerical and does not. Also note that the filter arguments could have been written on a single line, but it is useful to break up your code sometimes to make it more readable.

### Challenge - pipes

Subset the `surveys_complete` data to keep only the `species_id`, `weight`, `hindfoot_length`, `year` and `sex` columns and the animals collected on and after 1995.  Then plot a scatter plot of `weight` (x-axis) against `hindfoot_length` (y-axis) using this transformed dataset.
Do all the above using pipes, without creating any variables.

```{r, purl=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  # Select columns
  select(species_id, weight, hindfoot_length, year, sex) %>%
  # Filter rows
  filter(year >= 1995) %>%
  # Plot transformed data
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point()
```

### Challenge - plotting subset with different colour

Plot all the animals in the `surveys_complete` dataset as `weight` (x-axis) against `hindfoot_length` (y-axis).  Use the dataset created above which contains only the animals that were collected on and after 1995 and highlight these points in red in the plot. **Hint**: create a new object called `survey_recent` that contains the dataset created above.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
```{r, purl = TRUE, eval=TRUE}
survey_recent <- surveys_complete %>%
                  select(species_id, weight, hindfoot_length, year, sex) %>%
                  filter(year >= 1995)
                  
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(data = surveys_complete) +
  geom_point(data = survey_recent, colour = "red", alpha = 0.4)
```

**Note:** In the example above we did not specify the `data` argument in the `ggplot` function because the arguments in the `ggplot` function should be common throughout the whole plot.  In this case we specified the respective data as separate layers in 2 different `geom_point` plots; the first plot is the data with all the animals in `surveys_complete` (points in black), the second plot is layered on top of the first plot and is a subset of the `surveys_complete` dataset (points in red).

## Creating new columns

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two columns. For this we'll use the `mutate` function.  

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys_complete %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys_complete %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000,
         weight_lbs = weight_kg * 2.20462)
```

There are other ways on how to create new columns.  Refer to the dplyr cheat sheet *Make New Variables* section. 

<br/>

:::exercise
### Challenge - the boxplot

Using the `surveys_complete` dataset, create a [boxplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html) for each year on the x-axis and weight in kg on the y-axis. Use the subset dataset that was transformed in the previous challenge, *i.e.* the one that has the recent observations (from 1995 onwards).  As before try to do all the operations using pipes, without creating variables.  
**Hint**:  You will need to use the `as_factor` function to convert the `year` column to `factor` type.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

Your first attempt would be to use the code we used before to subset the `surveys_complete` dataset, but also adding the `mutate` function to add a new `weight_kg` column. Further more you will need to also add the `ggplot` function to draw a boxplot:

```{r, purl = TRUE, eval=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  # Add weight_kg column
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  # Select columns
  select(species_id, weight_kg, hindfoot_length, year, sex) %>%
  # Filter rows
  filter(year >= 1995) %>%
  # Plot transformed data
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = weight_kg)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

You might notice that this code produces a warning message about the continuous data type of the x-axis and also creates a box plot with one single box and whisker averaged over all the years on the x-axis, rather than one for each year in the dataset as requested.  As shown in the [`ggplot2` cheat sheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-visualization-1.pdf), box plots display a discrete variable on the x-axis and a continuous variable on the y-axis.  At the moment `year` is treated as a continuous variable since its data type is `double`  (you can see this from the tibble).  To fix this, we need to convert the data type of the `year` column to a categorical one (`factor`) so that each year can be plotted as a separate box and whisker.

The `forcats` package that is part of `tidyverse` has the [`as_factor`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/as_factor.html) function which does just that; it converts a variable into a factor. See the updated code below, which uses the `as_factor` function: 

```{r, purl = TRUE, eval=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  # Add weight_kg column
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  # Select columns
  select(species_id, weight_kg, hindfoot_length, year, sex) %>%
  # Filter rows
  filter(year >= 1995) %>%
  # Convert the year column to a factor
  mutate(year = as_factor(year)) %>%
  # Plot transformed data
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = weight_kg)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

Notice that since we need to keep only observations that have been observed from 1995 onwards, we need to convert the `year` column to a `factor` *after* we filter the rows, as otherwise the row filtering operation will not be possible.  This is because the new `year` column of type `factor` does not have any ordering in its categories so perfoming `year >= 1995` would not be possible.

It is also possible to convert the `year` variable directly from within `ggplot`, thereby skipping the `mutate` step from above. We can do this using the updated code below (output is the same as above):

```{r, purl = TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  # Add weight_kg column
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  # Select columns
  select(species_id, weight_kg, hindfoot_length, year, sex) %>%
  # Filter rows
  filter(year >= 1995) %>%
  # Convert the year variable and plot transformed data
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = as_factor(year), y = weight_kg)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

**Note on the boxplot**

As mentioned the boxplot is used to visualise the distribution of a continuous variable.  In the example above we displayed the distribution of `weight` over the different years.  The figure below illustrates the different components of the boxplot. The bottom line of the box represents the 25th quantile, middle line the 50th quantile (or median) and the top line of the box is the 75th quantile. The whiskers can be thought of as defining the boundary of the confidence intervals of the distribution.  The dots outside these whiskers are the outliers.

## Sorting data

To sort your data `dplyr` provides function `arrange`.  
```{r}
# Sort weight in ascending order (default)
surveys_complete %>%
  arrange(weight)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, results=TRUE, layout="l-body-outset"}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(surveys_complete %>% arrange(weight))
```

To sort your data in descending order you will need to use `desc()`.
```{r}
# Sort weight in descending order 
surveys_complete %>%
  arrange(desc(weight))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, results=TRUE, layout="l-body-outset"}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(surveys_complete %>% arrange(desc(weight)))
```

You can sort your dataset based on the values of multiple columns:
```{r}
# Sort weight in ascending order and hindfoot_length in descending order
surveys_complete %>%
  arrange(weight, desc(hindfoot_length))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, results=TRUE, layout="l-body-outset"}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(surveys_complete %>% arrange(weight, desc(hindfoot_length)))
```

As you can see from the result returned, the animals with the smallest weight are at the top.  When there is a tie, *i.e.,* more than one animal has the same weight, the animals are sorted in descending order of `hindfoot_length`. As you can see, the subset of animals with `weight` of 4 have been sorted in descending order based on `hindfoot_length`.

<br/>

## Summarising data

Creating summaries of your data would be a good way to start describing the variable you are working with.  Summary statistics are a good example of how one can summarise data.  We will not cover details about summary statistics in this course, but we will look at how we can summarise data in R. 

### Frequency - `count`

The most straightforward summary data is counting the the number of observations or frequencies. Frequencies are normally calculated when working with discrete variables that have a finite number of values, such as categorical data.  In our `surveys_complete` dataset, let us obtain the frequecies of male and female animals present.  We can do this by counting the number of "M" and "F" present in the dataset.  To do this use the `dplyr` function `count` as follows:

```{r, results=TRUE}
  surveys_complete %>%
    count(sex)
```

As you can see `count` has grouped the categories present in the `sex` column and returned the frequency of each category.  If we wanted to count *combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`, we would specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

```{r, results=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  count(sex, species) 
```

```{r, purl = TRUE}

  arrange(species, desc(n))
```
</details>
:::

<br/>

### Plotting histograms

If you would like to plot the distribution of a **single continuous variable** the frequency will be automatically calculated, so you do not need to use `count()` to calculate the frequency beforehand.  The x-axis is automatically divided into bins and the number of observations of the continuous variable in each bin is shown as a bar in the histogram.  In the `ggplot2` package a histogram can be plotted using the `geom_histogram` function.  

Let us plot a histogram for the continuous variable `weight`:
```{r, fig.show=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(weight)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

You can identify display categories in the histogram by plotting a stacked histogram which will show categories for each group stacked on top of each other.  This is done by using the `fill` argument in the aesthetic function.  If we want to display `sex` in our `weight` histogram:

```{r, fig.show=TRUE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(weight, fill = sex)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```

Note that the default number of bins in a histogram is 30.  To get have a granular display you can increase the number of bins by using the argument `bins` in the `geom_histogram` function as above.

There are other plots that can be used for a single continuous variable (see ONE VARIABLE continuous section on [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/data-visualization-1.pdf)).

### Summarising data with `summarise()`

When working with continuous variables, one of the most popular summary statistic is the mean.  If we try to caclulate the mean on `weight` in the `surveys_complete` dataset we get an error:

```{r, error=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  mean_weight = mean(weight)
```
This is because in `dplyr` you will need to use the `summarise` function to be able to create summaries of your data. 

The `summarise` function is used when you want to reduce multiple values in your columns to a single value.  If we try to calculate the mean using `summarise()` this time:
```{r, results=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```
As seen from the result, the `mean` of the values present in the `weight` column is 41.8. This value is the mean of `weight` of the entire data set. We already know that there are many different groups within the data set, so this is not very informative. It would therefore be good to calculate `mean` values for groups within the data. We cover how to do this next.

## Grouping data

In the examples above we learned how to summarise data over all observations, *e.g.,* we calculated the mean over all observations using the `summarise` function. However, in data analysis, especially when dealing with big data, a common approach to data exploration is the [**split-apply-combine**](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01) strategy. The idea behind this strategy is to split the data into more manageable pieces, apply any operations required on the data independently on each piece and then combine the results together. The figure below illustrates the approach that is done in the split-apply-combine approach.

![](img/split-apply-combine.svg)  

Let's work on an example on how we can apply the split-apply-combine strategy on the `surveys_complete` dataset.  We would like to split the data by the different categories present in the `sex` column and calculate the mean weight for each category.  We can do this easily by using the `group_by` function in the `dplyr` package:
```{r, results=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

You can also group by multiple columns:
```{r, results=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarise multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:

```{r, results=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```

:::exercise

### Challenge - grouping & summarising

Use `group_by()` and `summarise()` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot length for each species (using `species_id`). Also add the number of observations in a column called `n_obs` (hint: see `?n`).

```{r, purl = TRUE, results=TRUE}

    group_by(species_id) %>%
    summarise(
        mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length),
        min_hindfoot_length = min(hindfoot_length),
        max_hindfoot_length = max(hindfoot_length),
        n_obs = n()
    )

# Exporting/Writing data to files

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to transform your raw data, you may want to export these new datasets to share them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a [`write_csv` function](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/write_delim.html) that generates CSV files from data frames and tibbles which is also present in the `readr` package.

Before using `write_csv()`, note that we are going to write the data to the `data_processed` folder. This is to keep these data separate from our raw data in `data_raw`. 

Let's save the `surveys_complete` tibble in `data_processed/surveys_complete.csv` file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(surveys_complete, "data_processed/surveys_complete.csv")
```


# Additional information
The topics we have covered so far are just a small fraction of what is possible in R. Below is information on some more advanced topics of data wrangling and plotting. The topics and challenges are hopefully self-explanatory!

## Facetting

The `ggplot2` package has a way of creating different plots based on the different categories in the data.  This is known as **facetting**.  With facetting we do not need to use `group_by()` to split the data into different groups to be able to plot the different categories in different plots as `ggplot2` does this automatically.

There are two types of `facet` functions:

- `facet_wrap()` arranges the different plots into muliple rows and columns to cleanly fit on one page.
- `facet_grid()` plots all the categories in 1 row or 1 column.

Let us see this in action.

```{r, fig.show=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>% 
  group_by(year, genus) %>% 
  count() %>% 

ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(facets = vars(genus))
```

As you can see, each genus has been plotted as a separate plot.  It is now clear which are the genera that were observed the most.  Another advantage of facetting is that it uses a common axes and all plots are aligned to the same values on the axes, making the different plots comparable.  If you want to have different axes for each plot you can do so by using the `scales` argument.  
```{r, fig.show=TRUE}
surveys_complete %>% 
  group_by(year, genus) %>% 
  count() %>% 

ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(facets = vars(genus), scales = "free")
```

The pattern of the graphs that before were hardly visible, *e.g.,* Baiomys, is now clear as the axes have been rescaled to fit the data.  This is the main advantage of using **free scales**.  The disadvantage is that the different plots are not comparable as before.  

If we would like to see if there is any difference between the `sex`, we can do this by adding `sex` as another grouping to `count()`. Let's assign it to an object `yearly_sex_counts`.
```{r}
yearly_sex_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
                      count(year, genus, sex)
```
`yearly_sex_counts` will now look like:
```{r, echo=FALSE, results=TRUE}
yearly_sex_counts
```
This should now allow us to also split by `sex`.  We can use colour to distinguish between the `sex` categories:
```{r, fig.show=TRUE}
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, colour = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(genus))
```

Let us do the same thing with `facet_grid()` so that we can understand the difference between the two facetting techniques in the `ggplot2` package. With `facet_grid()` you specify what variable you would like to split on as in the `rows` or `cols` arguments:

<a name="facet_grid_row"></a>
```{r, fig.show=TRUE} 
surveys_complete %>% 
  group_by(year, genus) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
    geom_line() +
    # Display the genera as columns
    facet_grid(cols = vars(genus))
```

As you can see `facet_grid()` placed all the categories of `genus` in 1 row, unlike `facet_wrap()` which have spread them over multiple rows to fit well in 1 page. 
Let us split the plots by `sex` as well by plotting `sex` as the rows:
```{r, fig.show=TRUE}
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, 
  mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex), cols = vars(genus))
```

>More information on further functionality of facetting can be found in the [`facet_wrap()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html) and [`facet_grid()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html) documentation.  


> ### Challenge
>
>Instead of splitting the plots based on `sex` display the `sex` as different coloured line graphs in the same plot.
>
>```{r, answer=TRUE}
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, 
  mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, colour = sex)) +

## Reshaping data - pivot

In the data exploration workflow we discussed how to structure our data leading to the four rules defining a tidy
dataset:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
4. Each type of observational unit forms a table

Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit forms a table.

In `surveys` , the rows of `surveys` contain the values of variables associated
with each record (the unit), values such as the weight or sex of each animal 
associated with each record. What if instead of comparing records, we 
wanted to compare the different mean weight of each genus between plots? (Ignoring `plot_type` for simplicity).

We'd need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprised of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms this means the values
in `genus` would become the names of column variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean weight observed on each plot.

Having created a new table, it is therefore straightforward to explore the 
relationship between the weight of different genera within, and between, the
plots. The key point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure,
but we have **reshaped** the data according to the observations of interest:
average genus weight per plot instead of recordings per date.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into values of
a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions, `pivot_wider()`
and `pivot_longer()`.

### Widening data with `pivot_wider()`

`pivot_wider()` takes three principal arguments:

1. the `data` 
2. the `names_from` column variable whose values will become new column names.  
3. the `values_from` column variable whose values will fill the new column variables.

Further arguments include `values_fill` which, if set, fills in missing values with 
the value provided.

Let's use `pivot_wider()` to transform surveys to find the mean weight of each 
genus in each plot over the entire survey period. We use `filter()`,
`group_by()` and `summarise()` to filter our observations and variables of 
interest, and create a new variable for the `mean_weight`. We use the pipe as 
before too.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_gw <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(plot_id, genus) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight))
str(surveys_gw)
```

This yields `surveys_gw` where the observations for each plot are spread across
multiple rows, 196 observations of 3 variables. 
Using `pivot_wider()` to key on `genus` with values from `mean_weight` this becomes
24 observations of 11 variables, one row for each plot. We again use pipes:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_wider <- surveys_gw %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = genus, values_from = mean_weight)
str(surveys_wider)
```

![](img/wider_data_R.png)

We could now plot comparisons between the weight of genera in different plots, 
although we may wish to fill in the missing values first, using the `values_fill` argument.
**Note**: be careful when replacing `NA` with zero, since a `mean_weight` of would be recognised as an actual measurement,
and not as a missing value!

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_gw %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = genus,
    values_from = mean_weight,
    values_fill = list(mean_weight = 0)
    )
```

### Lengthening data with `pivot_longer`

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in the
form of `surveys_wider`, where the genus names are column names, but we 
wish to treat them as values of a genus variable instead.

In this situation we are lenghtening the data by taking the column names and turning them into a
pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names as values, and
the other variable contains the values previously associated with the column names.

`pivot_longer()` takes four principal arguments:

1. the `data`
2. the `cols` containing the names of the columns we want to pivot into a longer format
3. the `names_to` containing a string specifying the name of the column to create from the data stored in the column names of `data`
4. the `values_to`containing a string specifying the name of the column to create from the data stored in cell values.

To recreate `surveys_gw` from `surveys_wider` we would create a column using `names_to` called
`genus`. We would also need to create a column called `mean_weight` using the `values_to` argument.
Lastly, we would use all columns apart from `plot_id` to pivot into a longer format. Here we drop `plot_id` column with a minus sign.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_longer <- surveys_wider %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -plot_id,
    names_to = "genus",
    values_to = "mean_weight")
str(surveys_longer)
```

![](img/longer_data_R.png)

Note that now the `NA` genera are included in the longer format. Making data wider
and then longer can be a useful way to balance out a dataset so every
replicate has the same composition.

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include. This can be
useful if you have a large number of identifying columns, and it's easier to
specify what to gather than what to leave alone. And if the columns are in a
row, we don't even need to list them all out - just use the `:` operator!

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_wider %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = Baiomys:Spermophilus,
    names_to = "genus",
    values_to = "mean_weight") %>%
  head()
```

## Reshaping data - joining tables

Often data is spread out over multiple tables, instead of in one large, single table. Why collect data in multiple tables? 
- Not efficient to include all information in a single table.
- Redundant information makes it more difficult to update or revise data.
  - Make changes in one place, not hundreds of places.
- Use multiple tables
- Each table contains a single kind of information, for example in our case we could split the data into three tables:
  - `surveys`: information about individuals
  - `species`: information about species
  - `plots`: information about plots
- If a species name changes we only need to change it in the species table
- Connect tables using joins to describe relationships between tables

To illustrate the joining of different tables we will create two tables: `hindfoot_length_join` and `weight_join`, which contain the average `hindfoot_length` and `weight` per genus, respectively. To simplify the example, we are only using three genera, two of which are common between the tables. These are taken using the `slice` function. For more information, see `?slice`.

```{r, eval=TRUE, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
# Create a summary table for mean hindfoot_length
hindfoot_length_join <- surveys %>%
  group_by(genus) %>% 
  summarise(hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  slice(4,8,11)

# Create a summary table for mean weight
weight_join <- surveys %>%
  group_by(genus) %>% 
  summarise(weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  slice(4,8,15)

hindfoot_length_join
weight_join
```
As can be seen above, the _Baiomys_ and _Chaetodipus_ genera are common between the two tables. _Dipodomys_ only occurs in `hindfoot_length_join` and _Perognathus_ only in `weight_join`.

Joining of tables is done using the **mutating join** functions in [`dplyr` documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html). All of `join` functions take three arguments, two table names (the tables to join, the left-hand side and right-hand side) and a common key defined in `by =`. Here we look at the four most commonly used `join` functions, which are illustrated in the image below.

1. `left-join`. This joins matching rows from the right-hand side table to the left-hand side table.
2. `right_join`. This joins matching rows from the left-hand side table to the right-hand side table.
3. `inner_join`. This retains only rows that occur in both tables.
4. `full_join`. This retains _all_ values from _all_ rows.

In this case we want to join the data by `genus`, so we use `by = genus` as the common key.

## Customisation of plots

Though the default visualisation of `ggplot2` plots is already at a good standard, there are several ways one can improve even further the visualisations.  

### Labels

Let us start customising the last plot we have plotted by renaming the axes and adding a title to the plot.  This is done by using the [`labs`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html) function:

```{r, fig.show=TRUE}
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(genus)) +
  labs(title = "Observed genera through time",
       x = "Year of observation",
       y = "Number of animals")
```
         
The major item that needs fixing in the plot is the text on the x-axis as this crammed and is not readable at the moment. This is mainly due to the fact that the size of the plot is dependent on the size of the window (in this case RStudio).  You can work around this by saving your plot to a file and specifying the width of the plot ([see Saving a plot to a file section](#saveplot)). **Themes** in the `ggplot2` package control the display of all non-data elements of the plot.  Let us start customising the text on the x-axis by changing its size and position using the `theme` function.  Note that `theme()` has several other arguments and you can read more about them in the [`theme()` documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html).

```{r, fig.show=TRUE}         
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, colour = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(genus)) +
    labs(title = "Observed genera through time",
         x = "Year of observation",
         y = "Number of animals")  +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5), 
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7), 
          strip.text=element_text(size = 7, angle = 45))
```
         
         
### Legend

With the plot already looking better, the last thing we would like to change is the legend.  Legends are very tricky in `ggplot2` as the fuction to use is determined by the data that is being displayed.  In this case the legend has been created based on colour groupings.  Therefore we can change the lengend title, categories and colour as follows:

```{r, fig.show=TRUE}         
ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, colour = sex)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(genus)) +
    labs(title = "Observed genera through time",
         x = "Year of observation",
         y = "Number of animals")  +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5), 
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7), 
          strip.text = element_text(size = 7, angle = 45)) +
    scale_colour_brewer("Sex", 
                       palette = "Set1", 
                       breaks = c("F", "M"), 
                       labels = c("Female", "Male"))
```

>Note: If you would like to see what other palettes are available please see [http://colourbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set1&n=3](http://colourbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set1&n=3).

### Themes

`ggplot2` has a set of themes that can be used to change the overall appearance of the graph without much effort. For example, if we create the [first plot](#firstplot) again and apply the `theme_bw()` theme we get a more simpler white background:
```{r, fig.show=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

A list of themes can be found in the [`ggplot2` documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-themes).

>Use what you just learned to create a plot that depicts how the average weight of each species changes through the years.

  group_by(year, species) %>%

    geom_line() +
    facet_wrap(facets = vars(species)) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))
